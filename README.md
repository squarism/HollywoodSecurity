Hollywood Security System

This is a Processing sketch that looks like one of those BS security systems in the movies.  Picture this, a bomb is going to go off unless the hero cop hacks 'a system'.

	Damsel: 	"Oh no!  We don't have the password!"
	Hero Cop:	"And the bomb is going to go off in one minute."
	Damsel: 	"We're dead!"
	Hero Cop:	"I'll break the mainframe password."
	Damesel:	"You can do that?"
	Hero Cop:	"Sure.  But I'll have to arrest myself for ..."
				[sunglasses]
				"... breaking and entering."

Use
=====
Get yourself a copy of Processing, failing that, there's some screenshots you can see here below (sshot_1.png etc).  Failing that, there's a page on [my blog](http://squarism.com/files/HollywoodSecurity/ "HollywoodSecurity") that you can check out the applet version of this thing.  It's best if you download the app and run it yourself if you're shooting a movie:

- [HollywoodSecurity Mac](http://squarism.com/files/HollywoodSecurity-mac.zip "HollywoodSecurity Mac")
- [HollywoodSecurity Windows](http://squarism.com/files/HollywoodSecurity-win.zip "HollywoodSecurity Windows")

The password is muffin.

After the password is entered (enter key), you're in.  It doesn't do anything after that.  Hit ESC to quit.
